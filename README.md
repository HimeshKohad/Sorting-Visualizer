## Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is a web application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms. It allows you to observe how different sorting algorithms work by animating the process of sorting a set of elements.


### ***Features:***

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and more.
- Watch as the sorting algorithm progresses step by step, with elements being compared, swapped, and sorted.
- Adjust the speed of the visualization to better understand the sorting process.
- Gain insights into how different algorithms perform in terms of time complexity and efficiency.
